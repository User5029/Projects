# This is a github repository for the different projects, scripts and configurations I use.

## This is still in development.

- It is worth noting that these scripts can be seen in the folder name scripts.
- It is better to to run any of the commands through a ssh client and have access to the 'sudo' command. 
### Currently Got:

#### Software: 
- ```Grafana```

#### Scripts:
- ```install.sh``` --> Run apt-get install and apt-get upgrade for you.
